 *
 * Without this, a session the app was killed during vanished completely, which is
 * a large part of why practice minutes systematically undercounted real usage.
 * The checkpoint is a single key overwritten every few seconds; the next launch
 * turns a stale one into an `interrupted` record (see `lib/history-store.ts`).
 *
 * Backgrounding pauses rather than stopping, and deliberately does NOT auto-resume
 * on return: the user left, so coming back should be their choice.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE. Clearing the checkpoint is the CALLER's job, via `end()`, and it must
 * happen exactly when the attempt has been written down. Unmount is the wrong
 * trigger in both directions: `router.push('/session/results')` does not unmount
 * the practice screen, so a finished session's checkpoint would linger and be
 * recovered a second time on the next launch (double-counting its minutes); and
 * the dismiss path unmounts *while* its fire-and-forget `stop()` is still
 * processing, so clearing on unmount would delete the very checkpoint that covers
 * those seconds.
